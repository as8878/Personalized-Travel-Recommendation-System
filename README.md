# Personalized Travel Recommendation System

An end-to-end personalized travel planning system built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuned LLaMA-2 (QLoRA), semantic retrieval, and query classification. This system generates highly personalized travel recommendations and policy guidance by combining user queries with external travel knowledge bases.

---

## Overview

Travel planning can be time-consuming and fragmented, requiring users to search across multiple sources for destination guidelines, activity options, and accommodations. This project streamlines that process by leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuned models to generate highly relevant, personalized travel recommendations across multiple regions.

The system includes:

* Fine-tuned **LLaMA-2** using **QLoRA** for travel-specific knowledge.
* Query classification using **Mixtral (Groq)** to categorize queries into regions (USA, Canada, Europe, etc.).
* Retrieval of relevant context using **Pinecone** vector database with semantic embeddings.
* Answer generation using **LangChain** orchestration combining retrieved documents and LLM outputs.

---

## Key Features

* **Fine-tuned LLaMA-2 with QLoRA**: Custom fine-tuning for travel-specific question answering.
* **Semantic Retrieval**: Pinecone-powered vector search for document-level retrieval from domain-specific datasets.
* **Query Classification**: Mixtral (Groq) model used to classify queries into appropriate regions before retrieval.
* **Fully Modular Pipeline**: Separated ingestion, fine-tuning, retrieval, and generation components.
* **Highly Scalable**: Can easily scale to cover multiple destinations and knowledge bases.

## Dataset

* Fine-tuned on HuggingFace dataset: [llama-2-7b-guanaco](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/llama-2-7b-guanaco)
* \~1000 domain-specific travel samples related to regional policies and guidelines.

---

## Use Cases

* üß≥ Hyper-personalized travel itineraries.
* üåç Region-specific policy recommendations.
* ‚úàÔ∏è Travel agencies and individual travelers seeking AI-powered trip planning.

---
